# WASM bindings

`tree-sitter.js` and `tree-sitter.wasm` are copied from https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/releases/tag/v0.20.7 (MIT license, Â© Max Brunsfeld)

The remaining files in this directory were compiled from https://github.com/apertium/tree-sitter-apertium

Note that Emscripten must be at version 2.0.17 to regenerate these files (see https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/1829 for something vaguely resembling an explanation).
